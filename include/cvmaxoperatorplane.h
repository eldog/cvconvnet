/*! Max Operator planes are planes that take 2d pool size and
 *  then select from the input the maximum value from each 
 *  non-overlapping poolsize section
 * 
 * Each plane object represents one neuron (not a layer!).
 * The object also contains weights for this neuron and feature map
 * for this neuron.
