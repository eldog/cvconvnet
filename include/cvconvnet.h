\example testimg.cpp
File testimg.cpp provides a simple example of how to use CvConvNet object
\example sample.xml
File sample.xml provides a sample convolutional network configuration.
\example testmnist.cpp
File testmnist.cpp provides a little more complicated example of using the class.
The program runs over the entire MNIST test dataset and calculates error rate.
